#### Recommended IDE

**VSCode**  
Others: Atom, Sublime or simply choose as per your comfortability and experience.

#### Knowledge

Stack: MERN - Node-Express-Mongoose + React-Redux
Database: MongoDB [Cloud: Atlas]  
Deployment [Optional]: Possibilities: AWS/Firebase/Localhost/Heroku/Netlify [Used here: [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) - Heroku Download]

#### Installation

##### Node Package Manager (NPM)

If you don't have it installed, go ahead and install it. Refer here to follow the steps: https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm

##### ReactJS Library

Download the 'react' and 'react-dom' packages using npm. Also, 'create-react-app' which creates a basic project layout for the application.

```
>> npm i react
>> npm i react-dom
>> npm i create-react-app -g ('-g' tag installs it globally to be accessed from anywhere)

```

##### Deployment

Heroku - both for backend (APIs) as well as the react application (having seperate URLs).

## Further Possibilities

- Improving the basic layout/project structure of the application
- Further separating the business-presentational logic
- Better use of redux store and/or use of redux-saga
- Design improvements are definitely possible
